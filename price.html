Setting the right prices is an essential part of becoming a successful photographer. Yet, getting the price right is not straightforward.
Portrait photography pricing is especially tricky for those starting out.
A photographer may be completely convinced of the quality of their work. The clients, though, may not be
So, a photography business owner can not simply focus on technical and artistic aspects. Income is at least as important.

First, make sure your light source covers the entire group. Make sure the flash spreads both wide enough and deep enough to evenly light the entire group.
If the person closest to the flash is overexposed and the person farthest from the flash is underexposed, move the flash farther away from the group.
The farther away the flash is, the wider the coverage because there less fall off. Of course, there a balance to how far away the flash is. 
Too far away, and the light wont be bright enough.
While many groups can be photographed with a single flash, large groups cannot. If the group is larger than your lighting equipment will cover, 
stick to natural lighting.

<p id="p1">
Wedding photography is a photography niche that focuses on capturing the events of the wedding day. It also often includes an engagement photoshoot, 
boudoir photos, and the wedding preparations.
The photoshoot itself lasts from the beginning of the ceremony until the end, often until the middle of the night.
Recording the couple happiest day is truly motivating and uplifting. At each wedding, you get to experience a different love story and capture the 
couple love for one another.
