A Brief History of Photography and the People Who Made It Succeed Color photography started to become popular and accessible with the release of Eastman Kodak 
film in the 1930s. Before that, almost all photos were monochromatic  although a handful of photographers, toeing the line between chemists and alchemists, 
had been using specialized techniques to capture images for decades before. You will find some fascinating galleries of photos from the 1800s or early 1900s 
captured in full color, worth exploring if you have not seen them already.</p>
<p>These scientist-magicians, the first color photographers, are hardly alone in pushing the boundaries of one of the world newest art forms. The history of 
photography has always been a history of people  artists and inventors who steered the field into the modern era.</p>
<p>So, below, you will find a brief introduction to some of photography most important names. Their discoveries, creations, ideas, and photographs shape our 
own pictures to this day, subtly or not. Although this is just a brief birds-eye view, these nonetheless are people you should know before you step into the 
technical side of photography.
