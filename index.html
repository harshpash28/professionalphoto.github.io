<h1 class="heading"> Professional Photography </h1>

<p id="one">The word Photography literally means 'drawing with light', which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. 
Photography is the process of recording an image  a photograph  on lightsensitive film or, 
in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.
As a means of visual communication and expression, photography has distinct aesthetic capabilities. 
In order to understand them, one must first understand the characteristics of the process itself. One of the most important characteristics is immediacy. 
Usually, but not necessarily, the image that is recorded is formed by a lens in a camera. 
Upon exposure to the light forming the image, the sensitive material undergoes changes in its structure, a latent (but reversed) image usually called 
a negative is formed, and the image becomes visible by development and permanent by fixing with sodium thiosulfate, called hypo.
With modern materials, the processing may take place immediately or may be delayed for weeks or months.</p>
<p id="two">The essential elements of the image are usually established immediately at the time of exposure. This characteristic is unique to photography and sets it apart 
from other ways of picture making. The seemingly automatic recording of an image by photography has given the process a sense of authenticity shared by no 
other picture-making technique. The photograph possesses, in the popular mind, such apparent accuracy that the adage â€œthe camera does not lie has become an 
accepted.</p>
<p id="three">This understanding of photography supposed objectivity has dominated evaluations of its role in the arts. In the early part of its history, photography was 
sometimes belittled as a mechanical art because of its dependence on technology. In truth, however, photography is not the automatic process that is implied 
by the use of a camera. Although the camera usually limits the photographer to depicting existing objects rather than imaginary or interpretive views, 
the skilled photographer can introduce creativity into the mechanical reproduction process. The image can be modified by different lenses and filters. 
The type of sensitive material used to record the image is a further control, and the contrast between highlight and shadow can be changed by variations 
in development. In printing the negative, the photographer has a wide choice in the physical surface of the paper, the tonal contrast, and the image colour. 
The photographer also may set up a completely artificial scene to photograph.</p>
